# self_driving_repository
Repository for the lane guidance software from senior year of Marist

This is just a copy of the program I made at Marist that uses the nearest intersection of all the lines in an image to identify the midpoint of the horizon, or for a car, where the car should steer to drive in the middle of a lane. Also serves as a github test for me.
